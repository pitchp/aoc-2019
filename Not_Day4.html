/* day 4 part 1 

-It is a six-digit number. / Length = 6
-The value is within the range given in your puzzle input. / between
-Two adjacent digits are the same (like 22 in 122345). / adjacent is duplicated
-Going from left to right, the digits never decrease; they only ever increase or stay the same (like 111123 or 135679). / left =< right

How many different passwords within the range given in your puzzle input meet these criteria?

Your puzzle input is 357253-892942.
-------------------------------------
day 4 part 2

An Elf just remembered one more important detail: the two adjacent matching digits are not part of a larger group of matching digits.
Given this additional criterion, but still ignoring the range rule, the following are now true:

112233 meets these criteria because the digits never decrease and all repeated digits are exactly two digits long.
123444 no longer meets the criteria (the repeated 44 is part of a larger group of 444).
111122 meets the criteria (even though 1 is repeated more than twice, it still contains a double 22)
(1111 does not count. It is true because 22).
How many different passwords within the range given in your puzzle input meet all of the criteria?

logic -> at least one unique pair of duplicates
count value in array of values from part one -> if there are values that have only 2 occurrences then true
